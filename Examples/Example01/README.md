# TIML project - Example01

This is a small example about the execution of the full training-prediction-inspection pipeline.

The examples consists of a set of command lines managed by a Makefile. To run the example, from a Terminal, move to this directory and invoke make:

```sh
cd .../TIML/Examples/Example01
make
```

The tests are made on a small sampled subset of the ISIC2019 challenge. The goal being to show the execution of the full pipeline. Extend the sample dataframes with full image set and you will train a valid classifier.
